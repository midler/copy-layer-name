# Copy Layer Name

This is a Figma plugin designed to help you copy layer names directly. It becomes particularly useful when you need to quickly copy the name of selected layers in Figma's development mode, a functionality currently missing in Figma's native interface.

## Usage

1. Install the plugin.
2. Select the layer whose name you want to copy.
3. Run the plugin, and the layer name will be copied to your clipboard.

4. Click on `Click to choose a manifest.json file`.
5. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded or cloned this repository, and select the `manifest.json` file.
